# videoMorphBot

Aim:
Given a series of videos, and audio clips, this script shall randomly generate a video. This follows suit from the idea of randomly generated content. Everytime you run the script, and create content, this same content shall never be created in this fashion again.

How to run:
Currently setup to run via building the script.
Eventually this shall be changed to most likely a shell script which takes the video/audio paths as arguments
